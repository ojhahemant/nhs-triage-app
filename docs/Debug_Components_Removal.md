# Debug Components Removal - Update Log

## Summary
All debug components have been successfully removed from the Plastic Surgery Referral System UI to create a cleaner, production-ready interface.

## Changes Made

### Files Removed:
- `src/components/OpenAIDebugger.tsx` - AI service debugging interface
- `src/components/SimpleTest.tsx` - Simple testing component  
- `src/components/OllamaDebugger.tsx` - Legacy Ollama debugging interface
- `src/components/EnvDebugger.tsx` - Environment variable debugger

### Files Modified:
- `src/App.tsx` - Removed all debug-related code:
  - Removed debug button from header
  - Removed keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+D)
  - Removed debug state management
  - Removed debug component imports
  - Simplified main component to only show `NewReferralAssessment`

### Benefits:
- **Cleaner UI**: No debug button visible to end users
- **Smaller Bundle**: Reduced main bundle size by 1.38 kB
- **Production Ready**: Application is now focused solely on clinical functionality
- **Simplified Codebase**: Removed unused development tools

### UI Changes:
- **Before**: Header had a "Debug" button in top-right corner with keyboard shortcut access
- **After**: Clean header with only the application title "Plastic Surgery Referral System"

### Build Verification:
✅ Application builds successfully without errors
✅ All TypeScript compilation passes
✅ Bundle size reduced
✅ Core functionality preserved

## Current Application Flow:
1. User sees clean application header
2. Main assessment form loads immediately
3. No debug/testing interfaces accessible
4. Production-ready clinical triage interface only

The application now presents a professional, clean interface focused entirely on the clinical triage assessment workflow.

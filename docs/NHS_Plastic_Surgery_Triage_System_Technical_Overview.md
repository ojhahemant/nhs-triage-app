# NHS Plastic Surgery Triage System: Technical Overview

## Executive Summary

The NHS Plastic Surgery Triage System is an AI-powered application designed to assist healthcare professionals in prioritizing plastic surgery referrals. By analyzing clinical data and images, the system categorizes cases based on urgency, helping to optimize patient care pathways and resource allocation.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Application

The system is built as a modern React application with TypeScript, providing a robust, type-safe codebase that ensures reliability and maintainability. The application follows a component-based architecture that enables modular development and testing.

### AI Integration

The system integrates with local large language models (LLMs) via the Ollama API, providing:

1. **Case Categorization**: AI-powered analysis of clinical descriptions and supporting information
2. **Document Analysis**: Extraction and interpretation of text from uploaded clinical documents
3. **Image Analysis**: Visual assessment of clinical photographs and scanned documents
4. **Interactive Chat**: AI-assisted consultation for additional insights on categorized cases

### Key Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, CSS
- **AI Models**: 
  - Text Analysis: Llama3, Gemma, Mistral (configurable)
  - Vision Models: Llava, Llama3.2-Vision for document and image analysis
- **PDF Generation**: React-to-PDF for exporting assessment results
- **Data Processing**: Client-side text and image processing

## Core Features

### 1. Patient Data Collection

The system captures essential patient information:
- Date of birth (with automatic age calculation)
- Clinical description of lesions
- Symptoms and relevant medical context
- Additional clinical notes

### 2. Document Processing

The application supports:
- Upload of various document formats (PDF, DOCX, images)
- AI-powered text extraction from documents
- Image analysis with configurable vision models
- OCR for handwritten notes and printed documents

### 3. AI-Powered Categorization

Cases are categorized into four priority levels:
- **Urgent**: Requiring attention within 2 weeks
- **Routine**: Standard clinical pathway
- **Non-Priority**: Lower clinical urgency
- **Multi-Disciplinary Review**: Cases requiring specialized team assessment

Each categorization includes:
- Confidence scoring
- Clinical rationale
- Recommended timeframes

### 4. Interactive AI Consultation

Healthcare professionals can engage with the AI system through a chat interface to:
- Ask follow-up questions about the case
- Request clarification on categorization rationale
- Explore potential clinical pathways
- Consider differential diagnoses

### 5. Reporting and Documentation

The system provides:
- PDF export of assessment results
- Clear visualization of urgency levels
- AI model accountability (showing which model was used)
- Professional documentation for clinical records

## Security and Compliance Considerations

### Data Processing

- All processing occurs locally on the user's device
- No patient data is transmitted to external servers
- Images and documents are analyzed locally through the Ollama API

### AI Model Governance

- Models are configurable and can be updated as needed
- Confidence scores provide transparency about AI certainty
- Clear disclaimers indicate that final clinical decisions rest with healthcare professionals

### Clinical Safety

- The system is designed as a decision support tool, not a replacement for clinical judgment
- All AI recommendations include rationales to support informed decision-making
- Urgency indicators use the NHS color-coding system for immediate recognition

## Implementation Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Local Ollama installation for AI processing
- Sufficient RAM for handling document processing (8GB minimum recommended)

### Software Dependencies

- Ollama API service running locally
- At least one compatible LLM (Llama3 recommended)
- At least one compatible vision model (Llava or Llama3.2-Vision)

## Future Development Roadmap

1. **Integration with Electronic Health Records**: Enable direct integration with NHS digital systems
2. **Enhanced Analytics**: Reporting dashboards for service managers to analyze triage patterns
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design for tablet use in clinical settings
4. **Expanded Model Support**: Integration with additional AI models as they become available
5. **Multi-user Collaboration**: Allow multiple clinicians to review and comment on cases

## Conclusion

The NHS Plastic Surgery Triage System represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted clinical decision support. By augmenting clinical judgment with AI-powered analysis, the system aims to improve consistency in referral prioritization, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately enhance patient care while reducing wait times for urgent cases.

This solution balances cutting-edge AI technology with practical clinical requirements, maintaining human oversight while leveraging artificial intelligence to handle increasingly complex clinical data processing tasks.

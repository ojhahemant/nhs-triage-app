# Feature Evolution Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and the future direction of the NHS Plastic Surgery Triage System, based on the enhanced demonstration prototype. The goal is to evolve the current tool into a comprehensive clinical workflow and management platform.

## 1. Core Workflow Enhancements

### 1.1. Electronic Health Record (EHR) Integration
-   **Patient Lookup**: Directly query the EHR system using a unique patient identifier to retrieve and auto-populate patient demographics (Name, DoB, Address). This will reduce manual data entry and improve data accuracy.
-   **Data Synchronization**: Ensure patient data is consistent with the central EHR records.

### 1.2. Advanced Image Analysis
-   **Drag-and-Drop Upload**: An improved interface for uploading clinical images.
-   **AI-Powered Analysis**: The system will perform AI analysis on images to identify key clinical features, not just extract text. The results will be displayed alongside the image.

### 1.3. Drafts and Referral Management
-   **Automated Drafts**: The system will automatically save drafts as clinicians work on an assessment.
-   **Referral Letter Generation**: Automatically generate a formal referral letter populated with patient details, clinical information, and the AI-generated assessment.
-   **Secure Sharing**: Allow clinicians to securely send the assessment and referral to colleagues or other departments.
-   **Report Download**: Download a complete assessment report in JSON format for data interchange.

## 2. Dashboards and Tracking

### 2.1. Referral Tracking Dashboard
-   **Centralized View**: A dashboard to view and manage all referrals.
-   **Filtering and Searching**: Users will be able to filter referrals by status (e.g., Draft, Submitted, Reviewed), priority (Urgent, Routine), and search for specific patients.
-   **Status Updates**: The status of each referral will be clearly visible and will update as it moves through the triage process.

### 2.2. Analytics and Reporting Dashboard
-   **Key Metrics**: A dashboard displaying key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
    -   Total referrals processed.
    -   Average triage time.
    -   Referral priority breakdown (Urgent vs. Routine).
    -   AI model accuracy and confidence scores.
-   **Performance Monitoring**: Track system usage and efficiency to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

## 3. Communication and Collaboration

### 3.1. Secure Messaging System
-   **Internal Chat**: A built-in secure messaging feature for clinicians to discuss cases and collaborate on patient care.
-   **Conversation Management**: Users can start new conversations and manage ongoing discussions related to specific referrals.

### 3.2. Patient Portal and Communication
-   **Status Updates**: Generate and send status updates to patients regarding their referral. This can be done via email or a secure link to a patient portal.
-   **Customizable Instructions**: Provide patients with pre-operative or post-operative instructions tailored to their condition and priority level.

## 4. Administrative and Governance Features

### 4.1. Bulk Referral Upload
-   **CSV/XLSX Upload**: An interface for administrative staff to bulk-upload referrals from a CSV or Excel file.
-   **Data Validation**: The system will validate the data in the uploaded file and provide a summary of processed referrals, errors, and urgent cases.
-   **Error Reporting**: Download a report of any errors encountered during the bulk upload process for correction.

### 4.2. Audit Trail
-   **Comprehensive Logging**: A detailed audit log will track all significant actions within the system, such as patient data access, referral submissions, and messages sent.
-   **Transparency and Security**: The audit log will provide transparency and support clinical governance and security requirements.
-   **Exportable Logs**: Ability to filter and export the audit log for review.

## 5. Clinician and User Support

### 5.1. Clinical Guidelines Access
-   **Integrated Knowledge Base**: A searchable repository of clinical guidelines and best practices directly within the application.
-   **Quick Access**: Clinicians can quickly reference guidelines while performing an assessment.
-   **Favorites**: Ability to mark frequently used guidelines as favorites for quick access.

### 5.2. Interactive Tutorial and Help
-   **Guided Tour**: An interactive, guided tour for new users to learn how to use the system's features.
-   **On-Demand Help**: A tutorial system that can be launched at any time to provide assistance.

## 6. Accessibility and User Experience

### 6.1. Enhanced Accessibility
-   **Accessibility Toolbar**: A dedicated toolbar for accessibility features, including:
    -   High-contrast mode.
    -   Font size adjustment.
    -   Reduced motion mode to disable animations.
-   **Language Selection**: Support for multiple languages.
-   **Screen Reader Support**: Improved support for screen readers with ARIA attributes and live announcements.

### 6.2. Improved User Interface
-   **Modern Layout**: A redesigned interface with a sidebar for navigation and a clean, organized main content area.
-   **Responsive Design**: The application will be fully responsive and usable on various devices, including tablets and desktops.
-   **Notifications**: A system-wide notification system to provide feedback on user actions.

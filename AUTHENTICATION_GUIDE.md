# Plastic Surgery Triage System - Authentication System

## Overview

The Plastic Surgery Triage System includes a comprehensive authentication system that ensures only authorized users can access the medical triage system. This implementation provides secure login functionality with session management and full system access for authenticated users.

## Features

### ✅ Secure Login System
- Professional NHS-styled login interface
- Username and password authentication
- Form validation and error handling
- Loading states and user feedback
- "Remember me" functionality for username persistence
- Password visibility toggle for better UX

### ✅ Session Management
- 8-hour session duration with automatic expiry
- Persistent sessions using localStorage
- Automatic logout on session expiry
- Session restoration on browser refresh

### ✅ Full System Access
- Single user role with complete system access
- All features available to authenticated users
- No role-based restrictions
- Comprehensive feature access for clinical staff

### ✅ User Interface Integration
- User welcome message in header
- Role display in user interface
- Dropdown user menu with logout option
- Seamless integration with existing NHS design system

## Demo Credentials

For testing and demonstration purposes, the system includes one demo user account:

| Username | Password | Role | Full Name | Access Level |
|----------|----------|------|-----------|--------------|
| `clinician` | `nhs2025` | Clinician | Dr. Sarah Wilson | Full System Access |

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Context (`AuthContext.tsx`)
- React Context-based state management
- User session handling and persistence
- Login/logout functionality
- Session expiry management

### Login Component (`Login.tsx`)
- Professional NHS-branded login form
- Form validation and error handling
- Demo credentials display
- Responsive design for all devices

### Protected Route Component (`ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
- Route protection wrapper
- Role-based access control
- Loading states during authentication check
- Access denied pages for unauthorized users

### Router Integration
- Login route for unauthenticated users
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Automatic redirection based on authentication status
- Admin-only route protection for sensitive features

## Security Features

### Session Security
- 8-hour session timeout
- Automatic logout on expiry
- Session data stored in localStorage
- Session validation on each route change

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions
- Protected route enforcement
- Admin-only feature access
- Graceful handling of unauthorized access attempts

### User Experience
- Seamless login/logout flow
- Persistent authentication state
- Clear error messages and feedback
- Professional medical interface design

## Usage Instructions

### For End Users

1. **Initial Access**: Navigate to the application URL
2. **Login**: Use provided credentials from the demo account table
3. **Session**: Once logged in, your session will persist for 8 hours
4. **Logout**: Click the user menu (user icon) in the top-right corner and select "Sign Out"
5. **Auto-Logout**: Sessions expire automatically after 8 hours of inactivity

### For Administrators

1. **User Management**: Admin accounts have access to audit trails and bulk upload features
2. **Role Verification**: User roles are displayed in the header and user dropdown
3. **Session Monitoring**: All user sessions are managed automatically with secure expiry

## Production Deployment Notes

### Security Considerations

1. **Replace Demo Credentials**: The current demo credentials should be replaced with a proper user management system in production
2. **Secure Backend**: Implement proper backend authentication with encrypted passwords
3. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure all authentication happens over HTTPS in production
4. **Session Storage**: Consider more secure session storage mechanisms for production use

### Environment Configuration

1. **Authentication Provider**: Integrate with NHS authentication systems if available
2. **Session Duration**: Adjust session timeout based on organizational requirements
3. **User Database**: Replace demo users with actual user management system
4. **Role Management**: Implement dynamic role assignment and management

## Integration with Existing Features

The authentication system is fully integrated with all existing Plastic Surgery Triage System features:

- **Dashboard**: Real-time metrics and analytics (full access)
- **Assessment**: Patient triage and categorization (full access)
- **Post-Triaging Actions**: Letter generation and Op List management (full access)
- **Audit Trail**: System audit and monitoring (full access)
- **Bulk Upload**: Data import functionality (full access)
- **Help System**: Context-aware help and guidance (full access)
- **Referral Tracking**: Patient referral management (full access)
- **Messaging**: Clinical communication tools (full access)
- **Guidelines**: Clinical guidelines and protocols (full access)

## Support and Maintenance

### User Support
- Clear error messages for authentication failures
- Demo credentials displayed on login page for easy testing
- Intuitive user interface with NHS design standards

### Technical Maintenance
- TypeScript implementation for type safety
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Modular architecture for easy updates and maintenance
- Responsive design for all device types

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to NHS authentication systems
2. **User Management**: Implement proper user creation and management
3. **Advanced Security**: Add multi-factor authentication if required
4. **Audit Logging**: Enhanced logging for security and compliance
5. **Session Management**: Advanced session management with proper backend integration

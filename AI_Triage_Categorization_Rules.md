## 🧠 DETERMINATION FACTORS

The categorization engine uses a weighted combination of:

- **Clinical Description:** Lesion features, size, behavior  
- **Patient Age:** Advanced age raises risk level  
- **Symptoms:** Bleeding, ulceration, fixation, rapid growth  
- **Document Content:** Structured data from referral notes  
- **Image Analysis:** Visual patterns consistent with malignancy  
- **GP Assessment:** 
  - "GP concerned about malignancy" → URGENT  
  - "Urgent - Within 2 weeks" → URGENT  
  - "Soon - Within 4–6 weeks" → ROUTINE  
  - "Routine" → NON_PRIORITY

## 📊 CONFIDENCE SCORING

- **High Confidence (≥80%)** → Strong visual indicator  
- **Medium Confidence (50–79%)** → Moderate indicator, clinical review recommended  
- **Low Confidence (<50%)** → Weak indicator, triage flag raised for manual review  

Each case will include a **categorization rationale** generated by the AI, summarizing contributing factors to support clinician validation.
